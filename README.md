# Zoo

In this project, you practice creating components using state and props. Also, you learn how to work with lists and manipulate the state.

This example is the MVP and you should improve it.

## Instructions for your own project

1. Create a new React app
2. Clean App.js
3. Make Header, Footer and Card components (separated files)
4. The card must have

- image,
- a title,
- likes icon,
- count of likes,
- add and remove like buttons,
- remove the card button.

5. Import Header, Footer and Card to the App component
6. Style your app
7. Connect animalsList.js with App state
8. Display animals on the App (list and keys)

## Refactor your zoo app:

Add links to:

- Home // only two big images - links to animals and bird pages
- Animals // listing all animals, have animals search
- Birds // listing all birds, have birds search
- About // page about this project and summary of the features and what you learned with this project
