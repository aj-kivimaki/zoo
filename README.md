# Zoo App (react)

## Description

Browse pictures of animals in four categories (animals, fish, insects and birds). You can give likes and open each as a single page.

## About the Project

In this project, I practiced creating components using state and props. Also, I learned how to work with lists and manipulate the state.

See the [About](https://zoo-react-app.netlify.app/about) page for more detailes.

## Instructions I had for creating this project (MVP)

1. Create a new React app
2. Clean App.js
3. Make Header, Footer and Card components (separated files)
4. The card must have

- image,
- a title,
- likes icon,
- count of likes,
- add and remove like buttons,
- remove the card button.

5. Import Header, Footer and Card to the App component
6. Style your app
7. Connect animalsList.js with App state
8. Display animals on the App (list and keys)

Add links to:

- Home // only two big images - links to animals and bird pages
- Animals // listing all animals, have animals search
- Birds // listing all birds, have birds search
- About // page about this project and summary of the features and what you learned with this project
